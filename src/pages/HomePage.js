            <h3 className="h5 mx-5 px-5">
              In 2018 I started learning about copywriting, marketing, and
              psychology. From Robert Cialdini, to Joseph Sugarman, to Eugene
              Shwartz, I have read and put to work 10s of books worth of
              knowledge. From the headline to the call to action, I have
              mastered all areas of copywriting.

            <h3 className="h5 mx-5 px-5">
              The structure of my copy follows what I learned from copywriter
              Marcia Yudkin, in her course 'Basic Concepts and Techniques for
              Copywriting.' I like to first do my research. Then list out the
              points of differentiation. After that, I dramatize the
              differences. Then write out the bridge. Then write a compelling
              headline. And the Call-To-Action becomes the last part of my
              writing.

              I'm results driven and I view the copy like a swiss-watch. I
              engineer my marketing material to serve the purpose of converting
              prospects into repeat customers. I'm no fan of overly creative
              writing. My material aims to get the reader to stay engaged
              without drawing much attention to the written words themselves.

                  Social Media Marketing gets prospects to your website and
                  gives you more credibility. That's why it's important to post
                  engaging content regularly.

                  How many prospects you turn into leads decides how much money
                  you'll make. The fun sits here for me as I write and tweak to
                  maximize lead conversions.
